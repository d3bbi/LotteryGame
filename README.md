# Lottery Game
This is a simple lottery game that helped me to refresh my knowledge of *Java basics*.

ðŸŽ° The lottery is devided in three games:
1. **BONUS GAME:** four prizes will be drawn randomly. If at least two prizes match you win!
1. **LUCKY NUMBER:** try to guess the winning numbers drawn by the computer.
1. **GUESS THE SUM:** After the winning number are displayed try to guess how much is their sum.


Any suggestion or tip on the code is always welcome! ðŸ¤—
Happy Coding!
